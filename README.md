# MARS' Box of Games

A collection of handmade browser games written using TypeScript and CSS Grid layouts.

## Background

This is a fullstack web app, mainly to challenge myself learn all of the tech stack used in this project, but more importantly to solve common problems in game making using TypeScript and CSS grids. That's why all the games here are simple 2x2 grid games.

Most of the games here are originally written by hand using plain HTML, vanilla JS and CSS, to understand their basic algorithm. Decided to recreate them using a new stack and workflow to challenge myself more and provide a scalability for the project. Still, all these games are written by hand without any fancy game engine or framework or even canvas. Still just good old DOM elements and CSS.

Also this is a growing project, so will hopefully add more in the future in my free time, as long as the game being created follow the requirement â€” to mainly consists of grids.

As to why the project is structured this way, like I mentioned above, I intend to make this project scalable and have more contents and features in the future (multiplayer, etc).
